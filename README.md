## Description

As one of the founders of Estonia Experience, a company that helps people immerse themselves in the "the most advanced digital society in the world," I wanted to code from scratch our presentation website that allows people to learn about the business and apply as a participant.

#### What was accomplished from the project scope
* Wrote almost all code without relying on libraries, with the exception of React Bootstrap for Forms.
* Responsive and modern-looking website.
* Successfully implemented multiples types of animations with JS and CSS.
* Ability for visitors to apply and leave questions.
* Randomizing galleries of pictures and testimonials to give a fresh feeling to returning visitors.
* Automations with Firebase and Zapier to receive applications and questions via inbox and Drive spreadsheets.
* Cloud hosting and domain setup.
